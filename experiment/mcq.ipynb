      "scholars in the political sub-field of international relations (IR) tend to consider ‘the\n",
      "international’ as the political space in which these local and national political interests\n",
      "are represented in the form of interaction between states, regions of states, and a\n",
      "worldwide ‘states-system’. But since the late twentieth century, the concept of\n",
      "globalization has challenged these narrow, state-centric ways of thinking about politics.\n",
      "This book is about global politics, which is to say it is about how politics – struggles\n",
      "over power, how it should be distributed, and how we might best organise ourselves\n",
      "and live together as societies – works at the global level.\n",
      "But what is ‘the global’ when it comes to politics, and why does it matter? How does it\n",
      "differ from ‘the international’, as a way of seeing or imagining our world? What kinds\n",
      "of actors, institutions, and processes contribute the most to the globalisation of politics,\n",
      "and which ones try to hold back its tide, and why? This chapter explores the rise of a\n",
      "global imaginary in discussions of politics and international relations, considers its\n",

      "KEY ISSUES\n",
      "• What is ‘the global’ and how does it relate to ‘the international’?\n",
      "• How have the contours of world politics changed in recent decades?\n",
      "• What have been the implications of globalization for world politics?\n",
      "• How do mainstream approaches to global politics differ from critical approaches?\n",
      "• Which aspects of world politics are changed by globalisation, and which remain the\n",
      "same?\n",
      "\n",
      "FROM ‘THE INTERNATIONAL’ TO ‘THE GLOBAL’?\n",
      "The aim of this book is to provide an up-to-date, integrated and forward-looking\n",
      "introduction to global politics . It seeks to be genuinely global while not ignoring the\n",
      "international dimension of world affairs, accepting that ‘the global’ and ‘the\n",
      "international’ complement one another and are not rival or incompatible modes of\n",
      "understanding. In this view, global politics encompasses not just politics at the ‘global’\n",
      "level – that is, worldwide processes, systems and institutional frameworks – but politics\n",
      "at, and, crucially, across, all levels – the worldwide, the regional, the national and the\n",
      "subnational (see Figure 1.1). Such an approach reflects the fact that while, over an\n",
      "increasing range of issues, states interact with one another in conditions of global\n",
      "interconnectedness and interdependence, they nevertheless remain the key actors on the\n",
      "world stage.\n",
      "However, if the international paradigm, in which world affairs boil down,\n",
      "essentially, to relations between and among states, no longer constitutes an adequate\n",
      "basis for understanding, what has changed, and how profound have these changes\n",
      "been? How have the contours of world politics changed in recent years? The most\n",
      "significant changes have been the following:\n",
      "• The emergence of new global actors\n",
      "• The growth of interdependence and interconnectedness\n",
      "The erosion of the domestic/international divide\n",
      "• The rise of global governance.\n",
      "State: A political institution that successfully claims sovereign jurisdiction within\n",
      "defined territorial borders.\n",
      "Focus on . . . Defining global politics?\n",
      "What does it mean to suggest that politics has ‘gone global’? How does ‘global’ politics\n",
      "differ from ‘international’ politics? The term ‘international’ means between nations,\n",
      "and is today commonly understood to mean between nation-states or simply ‘states’.\n",
      "The term ‘global’, on the other hand, has two meanings. In the first, global means\n",
      "worldwide, having planetary (not merely regional or national) significance. The globe\n",
      "is, in effect, the world. Global politics, in this sense, refers to politics that is conducted\n",
      "at a global rather than a local, national or regional level. It therefore focuses primarily\n",
      "on the work of organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade\n",
      "Organization (WTO), which have a near universal membership, and on issues (such as\n",
      "the environment and the economy) where interconnectedness has gone so far that\n",
      "events and developments affect, actually or potentially, all parts of the world and so all\n",
      "people on the planet.\n",
      "In the second meaning (the one used in this book), global means comprehensive; it\n",
      "refers to all elements within a system, not just to the system as a whole. While such an\n",
      "approach acknowledges that a significant (and, perhaps, growing) range of political\n",
      "interactions now takes place at the global level, it rejects the idea that the global level\n",
      "has, in any sense, transcended politics at the national, local or, for that matter, any other\n",
      "level. In particular, the advent of global politics does not imply that international\n",
      "politics should be consigned to the dustbin of history. This is important because the\n",
      "notion that politics has been caught up in a swirl of interconnectedness that effectively\n",

This chapter explores the rise of a\\nglobal imaginary in discussions of politics and international relations, considers its\\nimplications for the study and practice of world politics – including issues ranging from\\nstate sovereignty to the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic – and reflects upon continuity\\nand change in global politics.\\nKEY ISSUES\\n• What is ‘the global’ and how does it relate to ‘the international’?\\n• How have the contours of world politics changed in recent decades?\\n• What have been the implications of globalization for world politics?\\n• How do mainstream approaches to global politics differ from critical approaches?\\n• Which aspects of world politics are changed by globalisation, and which remain the\\nsame?\\n\\nFROM ‘THE INTERNATIONAL’ TO ‘THE GLOBAL’?\\nThe aim of this book is to provide an up-to-date, integrated and forward-looking\\nintroduction to global politics . It seeks to be genuinely global while not ignoring the\\ninternational dimension of world affairs, accepting that ‘the global’ and ‘the\\ninternational’ complement one another and are not rival or incompatible modes of\\nunderstanding. In this view, global politics encompasses not just politics at the ‘global’\\nlevel – that is, worldwide processes, systems and institutional frameworks – but politics\\nat, and, crucially, across, all levels – the worldwide, the regional, the national and the\\nsubnational (see Figure 1.1). Such an approach reflects the fact that while, over an\\nincreasing range of issues, states interact with one another in conditions of global\\ninterconnectedness and interdependence, they nevertheless remain the key actors on the\\nworld stage.\\nHowever, if the international paradigm, in which world affairs boil down,\\nessentially, to relations between and among states, no longer constitutes an adequate\\nbasis for understanding, what has changed, and how profound have these changes\\nbeen? How have the contours of world politics changed in recent years? The most\\nsignificant changes have been the following:\\n• The emergence of new global actors\\n• The growth of interdependence and interconnectedness\\nThe erosion of the domestic/international divide\\n• The rise of global governance.\\nState: A political institution that successfully claims sovereign jurisdiction within\\ndefined territorial borders.\\nFocus on . . . Defining global politics?\\nWhat does it mean to suggest that politics has ‘gone global’? How does ‘global’ politics\\ndiffer from ‘international’ politics? The term ‘international’ means between nations,\\nand is today commonly understood to mean between nation-states or simply ‘states’.\\nThe term ‘global’, on the other hand, has two meanings. In the first, global means\\nworldwide, having planetary (not merely regional or national) significance. The globe\\nis, in effect, the world. Global politics, in this sense, refers to politics that is conducted\\nat a global rather than a local, national or regional level. It therefore focuses primarily\\non the work of organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade\\nOrganization (WTO), which have a near universal membership, and on issues (such as\\nthe environment and the economy) where interconnectedness has gone so far that\\nevents and developments affect, actually or potentially, all parts of the world and so all\\npeople on the planet.\\nIn the second meaning (the one used in this book), global means comprehensive; it\\nrefers to all elements within a system, not just to the system as a whole. While such an\\napproach acknowledges that a significant (and, perhaps, growing) range of political\\ninteractions now takes place at the global level, it rejects the idea that the global level\\nhas, in any sense, transcended politics at the national, local or, for that matter, any other\\nlevel. In particular, the advent of global politics does not imply that international\\npolitics should be consigned to the dustbin of history. This is important because the\\nnotion that politics has been caught up in a swirl of interconnectedness that effectively\\nabsorbs all of its parts, or ‘units’, into an indivisible, global whole, is difficult to sustain.
